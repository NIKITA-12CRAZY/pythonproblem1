Problem statement

# Write a command line program that simulates checking password strength based on certain rules. 
The program should accept the user input interactively and print the password strength. The 
password strength can be based on the following rules. 
1. Atleast 8 characters 
2. Contains atleast 2 special chracters 
3. Contains atleast 2 numbers 
4. Does not start with any number 
Each rule can be a different. The total of all rules should be 100 . You can decide how much 
weightage can be assigned to each rule. The password strength should be printed based on the 
score of all rules < 50 LOW, 50-75 - AVERAGE 75-90 - GOOD 90+ - VERY GOOD
If the score is less than 75, the program should display the two rules that contributed lowest to the 
score.
